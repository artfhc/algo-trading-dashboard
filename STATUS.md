# Project Status

## Current State: NON-FUNCTIONAL

⚠️ **This project will NOT run properly** due to several critical issues.

## Critical Problems

### 1. Missing Application Code
- **All Python files are empty** - The core application code has been cleared
- Files affected:
  - `app/main.py` (Streamlit entry point)
  - `app/data_loader.py` (S3 data retrieval)
  - `app/config.py` (Environment configuration)
  - `app/plot_utils.py` (Dashboard visualization)
  - `jobs/composer_ingest.py` (Data ingestion job)
  - `requirements.txt` (Dependencies)

### 2. Missing Configuration
- **No AWS credentials** - Missing required environment variables:
  - `AWS_KEY`
  - `AWS_SECRET`
  - `S3_BUCKET`
- **No S3 data** - Dashboard expects `latest.parquet` but no data exists
- **Empty dependencies** - `requirements.txt` is empty

### 3. Infrastructure Issues
- Data ingestion job has stubbed Composer API implementation
- No error handling or logging configured
- Missing security configurations

## What Would Happen If You Try to Run It

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```
**Result**: Fails immediately because `main.py` is empty

Even if files had content:
- Dashboard would show "No data found. Please check sync job."
- Data ingestion would fail due to missing AWS credentials
- No actual data visualization possible

## Required Actions to Make It Work

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Restore Python code** - All `.py` files need to be rebuilt
2. **Create proper requirements.txt** with:
   ```
   streamlit
   boto3
   pandas
   matplotlib
   ```
3. **Set up AWS credentials** and S3 bucket
4. **Implement data ingestion** to populate S3

### Short-term
1. Add proper error handling and logging
2. Implement actual Composer API integration
3. Add authentication (dashboard is completely open)
4. Configure security headers

### Security Concerns
- No authentication - anyone can access financial data
- AWS credentials hardcoded instead of using IAM roles
- No encryption or security measures
- Missing input validation

## Architecture Status

✅ **Good**: Project structure and deployment configs (`.render/`) are properly set up

❌ **Broken**: All application logic and dependencies are missing

## Next Steps

1. Decide whether to restore from backup or rebuild from scratch
2. Implement the security recommendations from the audit
3. Set up proper AWS infrastructure
4. Test locally before deployment
